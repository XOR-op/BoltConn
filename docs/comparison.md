# Comparison with other projects
## [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash)
Clash is a feature-rich proxy designed for rule-based routing. However, 
the open source version of Clash lacks important features like transparent
proxy, rule providers and advanced profiling. There is also no support for 
TLS MitM either in open source or proprietary version.

## Surge Mac
Surge Mac is an outstanding tool for intercepting and transmitting traffics
with support of multiple protocols. Also, Surge Mac supports TLS MitM features.
Despite its reputation, Surge Mac is a completely proprietary software with a high price.
Surge Mac also only support MacOS platform, meaning that Windows and Linux users cannnot
get access to its power.

## [Mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy)
Mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy with a console interface 
for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets. But Mitmproxy does not support highly-customizable
proxy function. Besides, Mitmproxy is written in Python, meaning that its performance
is limited.
