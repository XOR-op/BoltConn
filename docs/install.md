## Boltconn installation

There are two options available for installing boltconn on your system, (1) a prebuilt binary and
(2) manually building the application from source.

### Installing a prebuilt binary

Prebuilt binary images can be downloaded on the [latest
release](https://github.com/XOR-op/BoltConn/releases/latest) page of the boltconn repository. 

### Building and installing boltconn from source

While it is preferred to install a prebuilt binary, there are those instances when a manual build is
preferred. 

### 0. Satisfy dependencies

BoltConn is programmed in the rust programming language, so before you can build it yourself, you
must have a working copy of the rust programming language on your system which with many systems
will be accompanied by Cargo, the rust packaging management system. 

#### Installing rust

If you do not have rust yet installed on your system, you have two rather simple methods to achieve
itâ€™s installation. You can either download it from the package repository of your distribution or
you can use the "rustup.rs" tool to perform a userland installation. 

For using the package manager of your linux distribution, normally this is a matter of running:
```bash
sudo apt install rust
# OR
sudo dnf install rust
```

For acquiring rust through rustup simply run the following in your terminal:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# and then
rustup install
```
Which should provide you with a working installation of rust on your system. Then ensure that the
executables for rust are located in your path.


### 1. Acquire a copy of the source code

First, you will need to get a copy of the source code. To do so you must already have git installed
on your system, from there you will run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XOR-op/BoltConn && cd BoltConn
```

This will create a new folder on your system labeled "BoltConn" and will have changed directory into the repository folder.

### 2. Download required libraries and build the package

Downloading the required libraries for boltconn and performing the build operation can be performed
in one simple command. 

```bash
cargo build .
```

### 3. Install Boltconn

Once BoltConn has been built, you will then need to install it in your system.

```bash
sudo cargo install .
```

### 4. Finishing up

To ensure that you have successfully installed boltconn on your system run the following command:

```bash
boltconn -v
```
